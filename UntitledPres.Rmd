Hi `r d$firstname[i]`,

<p class="fragment">Welcome to your personalized Grit Lab report! </p>

<p class="fragment">We will go week by week, reviewing everything you have told us through Poll Everywhere.</p>

<p class="fragment">We hope this will help you reflect on what you learned and experienced during Grit Lab.</p>

___

Here's how you started. On week one, after learning the basics of grit:

- You rated your **passion** as `r d$pass_t1[i]`

- ...and your **perseverance** as `r d$pers_t1[i]`. 

___

Here's a graph:

```{r, echo = F}
d %>% 
  slice(i) %>% 
  select(Passion = pass_t1,Perseverance = pers_t1) %>% 
  gather(Facet,value) %>%
  rowwise() %>% 
  mutate(Score = numbers(value)[1],
         Time = "Pre-Class") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Facet,y = Score,fill = Facet))+
  geom_col(position = "dodge",alpha= .5)+
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(1,5)) +
  theme_ang()+
  theme(legend.position = "none")+
  theme(text = element_text(size = 25))
```

___

Then, you learned about goal setting, planning, and deliberate practice. 

<p class="fragment">You established a wish,</p> <p class="fragment">imagined its associated outcome,</p> <p class="fragment">identified potential personal obstacles, </p><p class="fragment">and then planned accordingly, using implementation intentions.</p>

___

Did it go according to plan? 

```{r, echo = F, fig.asp=521/1968}
d %>% 
  slice(i) %>% 
  select(woop_success) %>% 
  coord() %>% spread(axis,value) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(y,x))+
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0,100), ylim = c(0,100))+
  annotation_custom(rasterGrob(png::readPNG("wplan.png"),
                               width = unit(1,"npc"),
                               height = unit(1,"npc")),
                               0, 100, 0, 100) +
  geom_point(size = 10,shape = 23,fill = "white")+  
  theme_void()
```

____

And here is how much you learned

```{r, echo = F, fig.asp = 1/(1972/507)}
d %>% 
  slice(i) %>% 
  select(woop_learn) %>% 
  coord() %>% spread(axis,value) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(y,x))+
  annotation_custom(rasterGrob(png::readPNG("wlearn.png"),
                               width = unit(1,"npc"),
                               height = unit(1,"npc")),
                               0, 100, 0, 100) +
  geom_point(size = 10,shape = 23,fill = "white")+  
  theme_void()+
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0,100), ylim = c(0,100))
```

___

In week four, we discussed **feedback.** 

<p class="fragment">You told us that you felt <span style="color:blue">"`r d$criticalfeedback_feel[i]`"</span>  when receiving negative feedback,</p>

<p class="fragment">...and <span style="color:blue">"`r d$posfeedback_feel[i]`" </span>  when recieveing positive feedback.</p>

___

We then turned to learning about **stress.** 

<p class="fragment">In week 5, you reported feeling  <span style="color:blue">"`r d$lifestress[i] %>% tolower`" </span> of stress in your life right now, the primary source of it being <span style="color:blue">`r d$lifestress_source[i] %>% tolower`</span>. </p>

___

We also talked about **adversity and failure. **

<p class="fragment">Although related, adversity and failure are different: </p>

<p class="fragment">Adversity happens to us, whereas failure is something for which we are generally more responsible. </p>

<p class="fragment">Perhaps that is why you said that failure had made you feel <span style="color:blue">`r d$fail_feel[i]`.</span> </p>

<p class="fragment">However, how we interpret stress and failure matters...</p>

___

You said that you believe it is  <span style="color:blue">`r d$stress_neg[i] %>% tolower`</span> that the effects of stress are negative and should be avoided, 

<p class="fragment">...and that it is  <span style="color:blue">`r d$stress_growth[i] %>% tolower`</span> that stress facilitates learning and growth. </p>

___

Interestingly, research has found that people who believe that stress can facilitate learning and growth experience enhanced <span class="fragment bold">performance, well-being and health.</span> 

___


On week six, we talked about mentors

<p class="fragment">...you said for you, your most important mentor was <span style="color:blue"> `r d$mentor[i] %>% tolower %>% ifelse(. == "other","someone other than a teacher, coach, etc.",.)`.</span>  </p>

<p class="fragment">Here's how you described him or her:</p>

___

```{r, echo = F, fig.asp=1/1.6464088398}
d$mentor_style[i] %>% coord() %>% 
  rename(Dimension = axis,
         Value = value) %>% 
  mutate(Dimension = case_when(Dimension == "y" ~ "Demanding",
                               Dimension == "x" ~ "Supportive")) %>% 
  spread(Dimension,Value) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(Demanding,Supportive))+
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0,100),xlim = c(0,100))+
  theme_void()+
  annotation_custom(rasterGrob(png::readPNG("Mentor.png"),
                               width = unit(1,"npc"),
                               height = unit(1,"npc")),
                               0, 100, 0, 100) +
  geom_point(size = 5,shape = 23,fill = "white")

```

___

You also wrote a gratitude letter to  <span style="color:blue"> `r d$gratletter[i] %>% tolower`.</span> Do you remember what you said and how it made you feel?

___

On week eight, we talked about **interest.**

You saw this picture.

```{r, echo = F,fig.height=1}
include_graphics("Art1.png")
```

___

You rated it as 

`r d$painting1_enjoy[i]`/10 in enjoyment, 

`r d$painting1_interest[i]`/10 in interestingness, and

`r d$painting1_novel[i]`/10 in novelty. 

<p class="fragment">What about Francis Bacon's *Head Surrounded by Sides of Beef*?</p>

___

```{r, echo = F,fig.height=1}
include_graphics("Art2.png")
```

____

You rated it as 

`r d$painting2_enjoy[i]`/10 in enjoyment, 

`r d$painting2_interest[i]`/10 in interestingness, and

`r d$painting2_novel[i]`/10 in novelty. 

<p class="fragment">Prior research has shown that for most people, what is interesting is not necessarily related to what is enjoyable.</p>

___

We talked about states of extreme interest, or as Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi would call it, flow. 

<p class="fragment">You said you had experienced flow when <span style="color:blue"> `r d$flow[i]`.</span></p>

<p class="fragment">How do you feel when you are <span style="color:blue">`r d$flow[i]`</span> and get into the flow state?</p>

___

We then transitioned into **values**. 

<p class="fragment">There, you said you preferred to <span style="color:blue">`r d$wyr_knowvwealth[i]`</span>, <span style="color:blue">`r d$wyr_approval[i]`</span> and <span style="color:blue">`r d$wyr_routine[i]`</span>. </p>

<p class="fragment">These responses, in a sense, spoke about what you valued. </p>

<p class="fragment">You wrote a *This I Believe* essay, and located it here in Schwartz's value circle:</p>

___

```{r, echo=F,fig.asp=0.7443019943}
d$TIB_value[i] %>% 
  coord() %>%
  spread(axis,value) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x,y))+
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0,100),ylim= c(0,100))+
  annotation_custom(rasterGrob(png::readPNG("Values.png"),
                               width = unit(1,"npc"),
                               height = unit(1,"npc")),
                               0, 100, 0, 100) +
   geom_point(size = 5,shape = 23,fill = "white")+
  theme_void()


```


___

For **strengths,** Danny gave us an interesting lecture on the nature of talent. 

<p class="fragment">You defined talent as <span style="color:blue">`r d$talent_def[i]`</span>. </p>

<p class="fragment">You ranked your talents as <span style="color:blue">`r d$talent_rank[i]`</span>. </p>

<p class="fragment">You said your personality strength was <span style="color:blue">`r d$sig_strength[i]`</span>.</p>

___

We then examined **demand and social impact.** Here's how you said you cared about salary vs. social impact for your first career move:

```{r,fig.asp=0.2764505119, echo=F}
d$salaryvimpact[i] %>% 
  coord() %>% 
  spread(axis,value) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(y,x))+
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0,100),ylim= c(0,100))+
  annotation_custom(rasterGrob(png::readPNG("Social impact.png"),
                               width = unit(1,"npc"),
                               height = unit(1,"npc")),
                               0, 100, 0, 100) +
   geom_point(size = 5,shape = 23,fill = "white")+
  theme_void()
  
```


___

We also asked why you worked hard. 

<p class="fragment">You said you <span style="color:blue">`r d$workhard_prosoc[i] %>% tolower`</span> to working hard for wanting to help others, </p>

<p class="fragment">...and you <span style="color:blue">`r d$workhard_enjoy[i] %>% tolower`</span> with working hard because you enjoy it. </p>

___

Regarding demand, you said the most serious issues affecting your country were 

<p class="fragment"><span style="color:blue">`r d$topsocissue[i]`.</span> </p>

<p class="fragment">Would you like to work towards these?</p>

___

We then talked about **goal hierarchies,** which require you to have a top-level goal. How clear is your top-level goal? You said: <span style="color:blue">"`r d$toplevelgoal_clear[i]`". </span> 

<p class="fragment">Over time and with self-reflection, this will get clearer and clearer. </p>

<p class="fragment">One particular goal you have for the next six months is to <span style="color:blue">`r d$goal_6month[i]`. </span> </p>

<p class="fragment">You rated that goal in terms of how much it really represents you. Here’s what you said:</p>
___

```{r, echo = F}
d %>% 
  slice(i) %>% 
  select(Goal = goal_6month,
    External =  "goal_external",
              Introjected = "goal_introjected",      
              Identified =     "goal_identified"    , 
              Intrinsic ="goal_intrinsic") %>% 
  gather(Reason,Level,factor_key = T,-Goal) %>% 
  mutate(Level = case_when(Level == "Strongly disagree" ~ 1,
                           Level == "Moderately disagree" ~ 2,
                           Level == "Neither agree nor disagree" ~ 3,
                           Level == "Moderately disagree" ~ 4,
                           Level == "Strongly agree" ~ 5)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(Reason,Level, fill = c("red","red","blue","blue")))+
  geom_col(alpha = .5)+
  theme_ang()+
  coord_cartesian(ylim =c(1,5))+
  theme(legend.position = "none")+
  theme(text = element_text(size = 25))
  
```

___

Finally, on the penultimate lecture we looked at paying it forward. 

<p class="fragment">We learned about givers, takers, and matchers, and also about prosocial purpose. </p>

<p class="fragment">Here are your responses to items surveying this:</p>

___

```{r, echo = F, fig.asp=.85}
d %>% 
  slice(i) %>% 
  select(Taker = taker,Matcher = matcher,Giver = giver,
         `Benefit Others` = selftrans1,
         `Better World` = selftrans2,
         `Lasting Meaning` = selftrans3) %>% 
  gather(Item,Level,factor_key = T) %>% 
  mutate(Level = case_when(Level == T ~ 1,
                           Level == F ~ 0,
                           Level == "Not like me at all" ~ 0,
                           Level == "Not much like me" ~ .2,
                           Level == "Somewhat like me" ~ .4,
                           Level == "Mostly like me" ~ .8,
                           Level == "Very much like me"~1),
         Survey = c(rep("Reciprocity Style",3),rep("Self-Transcendence",3))) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(Item,Level,fill=Survey))+
  geom_col(alpha = .5)+
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::label_percent())+
  theme_ang()+
  facet_grid(Survey~.,scales = "free")+
  coord_flip(ylim = c(0,1))+
  theme(legend.position = "none")+
  theme(text = element_text(size = 25),
        plot.caption = element_text(size = 14))+
  labs(caption = "Reciprocity style answered as true/false.\nSelf-transcendence in a 5-point likert scale")
```

___

After all this time, we hope you have emerged from Grit Lab a little grittier than you started. 

<p class="fragment">Do you want to see how your grit rubric changed? </p>

<p class="fragment">Drumroll please...</p>

___

```{r, echo = F}
d %>% 
  slice(8) %>% 
  select(Passion1 = pass_t1,Perseverance1 = pers_t1,
         Passion2 = pass_t2,Perseverance2 = pers_t2) %>% 
  gather(Facet,value) %>% 
  rowwise() %>% 
  mutate(Score = numbers(value)[1]) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  mutate(Time = c("Pre-Class","Pre-Class","Post-Class","Post-Class"),
         Time = ordered(Time,levels = c("Pre-Class","Post-Class"))) %>% 
  mutate(Facet = rep(c("Passion","Perseverance"),2)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Time,y = Score,fill = Facet,col = Facet))+
  geom_col(position = "dodge",alpha= .5,col=NA)+
  geom_point(size=5)+
  geom_line(aes(group = Facet))+
  facet_wrap(~Facet,scales = "free")+
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(1,7)) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = 1:7)+
  theme_ang()+
  theme(text = element_text(size = 25))
```

___
Don't worry if the rubric doesn't yet reflect growth. It is only a coarse measure that cannot replace your own self-reflection. 

<p class="fragment">In any case, grit is not built in a day...</p>

<p class="fragment">...so stay passionate and persevering on the lifelong quest of choosing easy, working hard, and paying it forward.</p>

___

With grit and gratitude,

```{r, echo = F}
include_graphics("Sig.png")
```

Angela and the Grit Lab team.
