Hi `r d$firstname[i]`,

<p class="fragment">Welcome to your personalized Grit Lab report! </p>

<p class="fragment">We will go week by week, reviewing everything you have told us through Poll Everywhere.</p>

<p class="fragment">We hope this will help you reflect on what you learned and experienced during Grit Lab.</p>

___

Important note!

<p class="fragment">Sometimes, some students weren't able to respond to all polls.</p>

<p class="fragment">If the data for one of the polls is missing, the automatic report will display "NA".</p>

<p class="fragment">Okay, let's get started!</p>
___

p class="fragment">Do you remember the grit rubric, from the first time we met?</p>
<p class="fragment">
<img class="r-stretch" src="Rubric.png">
</p>
___

- You rated your **passion** as `r d$pass_t1[i]`

- ...and your **perseverance** as `r d$pers_t1[i]`. 

___

Here's a graph:

```{r, echo = F}
d %>% 
  slice(i) %>% 
  select(Passion = pass_t1,Perseverance = pers_t1) %>% 
  gather(Facet,value) %>%
  rowwise() %>% 
  mutate(Score = numbers(value)[1],
         Time = "Pre-Class") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Facet,y = Score,fill = Facet))+
  geom_col(position = "dodge",alpha= .5)+
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(1,6)) +
  theme_ang()+
  theme(legend.position = "none")+
  theme(text = element_text(size = 25))
```

___

Then, you learned about goal setting, planning, and deliberate practice. 

<p> <span class="fragment>You established a wish,</span> <span class="fragment">imagined its associated outcome,</span> <span class="fragment">identified potential personal obstacles, </span><span class="fragment">and then planned accordingly, using implementation intentions.</span></p>

___

Did it go according to plan? 

```{r, echo = F, fig.asp=521/1968}
library(png)
library(grid)
library(egg)
library(gganimate)

d %>% 
  slice(1) %>% 
  select(woop_success) %>% 
  coord() %>%
  spread(axis,value) %>% 
  mutate(g = list(rasterGrob(readPNG("Loc.png"), width=unit(24,"pt")))) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(y,x))+
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0,100), ylim = c(0,100))+
  annotation_custom(rasterGrob(png::readPNG("wplan.png"),
                               width = unit(1,"npc"),
                               height = unit(1,"npc")),
                               0, 100, 0, 100) +
  geom_custom(aes(data = g), grob_fun=identity) +  
  theme_void()
```

____

And here is how much you learned

```{r, echo = F, fig.asp = 1/(1972/507)}
d %>% 
  slice(i) %>% 
  select(woop_learn) %>% 
  coord() %>% 
  spread(axis,value) %>% 
  mutate(g = list(rasterGrob(readPNG("Loc.png"), width=unit(24,"pt")))) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(y,x))+
  annotation_custom(rasterGrob(png::readPNG("wlearn.png"),
                               width = unit(1,"npc"),
                               height = unit(1,"npc")),
                               0, 100, 0, 100) +
  geom_custom(aes(data = g), grob_fun=identity) +  
  theme_void()+
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0,100), ylim = c(0,100))
```

___

In week four, we discussed **feedback.** 

<p class="fragment">You told us that you felt <span style="color:blue">`r d$criticalfeedback_feel[i] %>% tolower()`</span>  when receiving negative feedback,</p>

<p class="fragment">...and <span style="color:blue">`r d$posfeedback_feel[i] %>% tolower`</span>  when receiving positive feedback.</p>

___

We then turned to learning about **stress.** 

<p class="fragment">In week 5, you reported feeling  <span style="color:blue">`r d$lifestress[i] %>% tolower` </span> of stress in your life right now, the primary source of it being <span style="color:blue">`r d$lifestress_source[i] %>% tolower`</span>. </p>

___

We also talked about **adversity and failure. **

<p class="fragment">Although related, adversity and failure are different: </p>

<p class="fragment">Adversity happens to us, whereas failure is something for which we are generally more responsible. </p>

<p class="fragment">Perhaps that is why you said that failure had made you feel <span style="color:blue">`r d$fail_feel[i] %>% tolower`.</span> </p>

<p class="fragment">However, how we interpret stress and failure matters...</p>

___

You said that you believe it is  <span style="color:blue">`r d$stress_neg[i] %>% tolower`</span> that the effects of stress are negative and should be avoided, 

<p class="fragment">...and that it is  <span style="color:blue">`r d$stress_growth[i] %>% tolower`</span> that stress facilitates learning and growth. </p>

___

Interestingly, research has found that people who believe that<strong> stress can facilitate learning and growth</strong> experience enhanced <span class="fragment"><strong>performance, well-being and health.</strong></span> 

___


On week six, we talked about mentors

<p class="fragment">...you said for you, your most important mentor was <span style="color:blue"> `r d$mentor[i] %>% tolower %>% ifelse(. == "other","someone other than a teacher, coach, etc.",.)`.</span>  </p>

<p class="fragment">Here's how you described him or her:</p>

___

```{r, echo = F, fig.asp=1/1.6464088398}
d$mentor_style[i] %>% coord() %>% 
  rename(Dimension = axis,
         Value = value) %>% 
  mutate(Dimension = case_when(Dimension == "y" ~ "Demanding",
                               Dimension == "x" ~ "Supportive")) %>% 
  spread(Dimension,Value) %>% 
  mutate(g = list(rasterGrob(readPNG("Loc.png"), width=unit(24,"pt")))) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(Demanding,Supportive))+
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0,100),xlim = c(0,100))+
  theme_void()+
  annotation_custom(rasterGrob(png::readPNG("Mentor.png"),
                               width = unit(1,"npc"),
                               height = unit(1,"npc")),
                               0, 100, 0, 100) +
  geom_custom(aes(data = g), grob_fun=identity)

```

___

You also wrote a gratitude letter to  <span style="color:blue"> `r d$gratletter[i] %>% tolower`.</span> Do you remember what you said and how it made you feel?

___

On week eight, we talked about **interest.**

We talked about states of extreme interest, or as Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi would call it, flow. 

<p class="fragment">You said you had experienced flow when <span style="color:blue"> `r d$flow[i] %>% tolower`.</span></p>

<p class="fragment">How do you feel when you are <span style="color:blue">`r d$flow[i] %>% tolower`</span> and get into the flow state?</p>

___

We then transitioned into **values**. 

<p class="fragment">There, you said you preferred to:</p> 

<p class="fragment"><span style="color:blue">`r d$wyr_knowvwealth[i]`</span>, rather than `r ifelse(d$wyr_knowvwealth[i] == wyr$wyr_knowvwealth[1],wyr$wyr_knowvwealth[2],wyr$wyr_knowvwealth[1])` </p>
<p class="fragment"><span style="color:blue">`r d$wyr_approval[i]`</span>, rather than `r ifelse(d$wyr_approval[i] == wyr$wyr_approval[1],wyr$wyr_approval[2],wyr$wyr_approval[1])`; and </p>
<p class="fragment"><span style="color:blue">`r d$wyr_routine[i]`</span>, rather than `r ifelse(d$wyr_routine[i] == wyr$wyr_routine[1],wyr$wyr_routine[2],wyr$wyr_routine[1])`.</p>

<p class="fragment">These responses, in a sense, spoke about what you valued. </p>

<p class="fragment">You wrote a *This I Believe* essay, and located it here in Schwartz's value circle:</p>

___

```{r, echo=F,fig.asp=0.7443019943}
d$TIB_value[i] %>% 
  coord() %>%
  spread(axis,value) %>% 
    mutate(g = list(rasterGrob(readPNG("Loc.png"), width=unit(24,"pt")))) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x,y))+
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0,100),ylim= c(0,100))+
  annotation_custom(rasterGrob(png::readPNG("Values.png"),
                               width = unit(1,"npc"),
                               height = unit(1,"npc")),
                               0, 100, 0, 100) +
  geom_custom(aes(data = g), grob_fun=identity) +  
  theme_void()


```


___

For **strengths,** Danny gave us an interesting lecture on the nature of talent. 

<p class="fragment">You defined talent as <span style="color:blue">`r d$talent_def[i]`</span>. </p>

```{r, include = FALSE}
tal = d$talent_rank[1] %>% str_split(",") %>% unlist() %>% trimws()
```


<p class="fragment">You ranked your top three talents as: <span style="color:blue"><span class="fragment">`r tal[1]`, </span><span class="fragment">`r tal[2]`, </span><span class="fragment">and `r tal[3]`.</span></span> </p>

<p class="fragment">You said your personality strength was <span style="color:blue">`r d$sig_strength[i]`</span>.</p>

___

We then examined **demand and social impact.** Here's how you said you cared about salary vs. social impact for your first career move:

```{r,fig.asp=0.2764505119, echo=F}
d$salaryvimpact[i] %>% 
  coord() %>% 
  spread(axis,value) %>% 
    mutate(g = list(rasterGrob(readPNG("Loc.png"), width=unit(24,"pt")))) %>% 

  ggplot(aes(y,x))+
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0,100),ylim= c(0,100))+
  annotation_custom(rasterGrob(png::readPNG("Social impact.png"),
                               width = unit(1,"npc"),
                               height = unit(1,"npc")),
                               0, 100, 0, 100) +
  geom_custom(aes(data = g), grob_fun=identity) +  
  theme_void()
  
```


___

We also asked why you worked hard. 

<p class="fragment">You said you <span style="color:blue">`r d$workhard_prosoc[i] %>% tolower`</span> to working hard for wanting to help others, </p>

<p class="fragment">...and you <span style="color:blue">`r d$workhard_enjoy[i] %>% tolower`</span> with working hard because you enjoy it. </p>

___

Regarding demand, you said the most serious issues affecting your country were:

```{r include = F}
soc = d$topsocissue[1] %>% str_replace_all(.,"income, discrimination","income/discrimination") %>% str_split(",") %>% unlist() %>% trimws()
soc[1:3]
```


<p class="fragment"><span style="color:blue">`r soc[1]`.</span> </p>

<p class="fragment"><span style="color:blue">`r soc[2]`.</span> </p>

<p class="fragment"><span style="color:blue">`r soc[3]`.</span> </p>

<p class="fragment">Would you like to work towards these?</p>

___

We then talked about **goal hierarchies,** which require you to have a top-level goal. How clear is your top-level goal? You said: <span style="color:blue">`r d$toplevelgoal_clear[i]`. </span> 

<p class="fragment">Over time and with self-reflection, this will get clearer and clearer. </p>

<p class="fragment">One particular goal you have for the next six months is to <span style="color:blue">`r d$goal_6month[i] %>% tolower`. </span> </p>

<p class="fragment">You rated that goal in terms of how much it really represents you. Here’s what you said:</p>
___

Red bars represent self-concordant motivation, while blue bars represent non-concordant motivation.

```{r, echo = F}
sc = d %>% 
  slice(i) %>% 
  select(Goal = goal_6month,
    External =  "goal_external",
              Introjected = "goal_introjected",      
              Identified =     "goal_identified"    , 
              Intrinsic ="goal_intrinsic") 

if(sc[2:5] %>% is.na %>% rowSums()!= 4){
  sc %>% 
    gather(Reason,Level,factor_key = T,-Goal) %>% 
  mutate(Level = case_when(Level == "Strongly disagree" ~ 1,
                           Level == "Moderately disagree" ~ 2,
                           Level == "Neither agree nor disagree" ~ 3,
                           Level == "Moderately disagree" ~ 4,
                           Level == "Strongly agree" ~ 5)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(Reason,Level, fill = c("red","red","blue","blue")))+
  geom_col(alpha = .5)+
  theme_ang()+
  coord_cartesian(ylim =c(1,5))+
  theme(legend.position = "none")+
  theme(text = element_text(size = 25))
}


```

___

Finally, on the penultimate lecture we looked at paying it forward. 

<p class="fragment">We learned about reciprocity style: givers, takers, and matchers. You also responded to items about prosocial purpose. </p>

<p class="fragment">Here are your responses to items surveying this:</p>

___

```{r, echo = F, fig.asp=.85}
rs = d %>% 
  slice(i) %>% 
  select(Taker = taker,Matcher = matcher,Giver = giver,
         selftrans1,
         selftrans2,
         selftrans3)

if(rs[1:6] %>% is.na %>% rowSums()!= 6){
  rs %>% 
  gather(Item,Level,factor_key = T) %>% 
  mutate(Level = case_when(Level == T ~ 1,
                           Level == F ~ 0,
                           Level == "Not like me at all" ~ 0,
                           Level == "Not much like me" ~ .2,
                           Level == "Somewhat like me" ~ .4,
                           Level == "Mostly like me" ~ .8,
                           Level == "Very much like me"~1)) %>% 
    spread(Item,Level) %>% 
    mutate(`Self-\ntranscendence` = mean(c(selftrans1,selftrans2,selftrans3),na.rm=T)) %>% 
    select(-selftrans1,-selftrans2,-selftrans3) %>% 
    gather(Item,Level,factor_key = T) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(Item,Level))+
  geom_col(alpha = .5)+
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::label_percent())+
  theme_ang()+
    coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0,1))+
  theme(legend.position = "none")+
  theme(text = element_text(size = 25),
        plot.caption = element_text(size = 14))+
  labs(caption = "Reciprocity style answered as true/false.\nSelf-transcendence in a 5-point likert scale")
}

```

___
<p class = "fragment">Remember your mood meter?</p>

<p class = "fragment">Here's how your mood evolved through the semester</p>
<p class = "fragment">
```{r, echo = F,out.width="100%"}
if(!is.na(d$No[1])){
  include_graphics(path)
}

```
</p>
___

After all this time, we hope you have emerged from Grit Lab a little grittier than you started. 

<p class="fragment">Do you want to see how your grit rubric changed? </p>

<p class="fragment">Drumroll please...</p>

___

```{r, echo = F}
pp = d %>% 
  slice(i) %>% 
  select(Passion1 = pass_t1,Perseverance1 = pers_t1,
         Passion2 = pass_t2,Perseverance2 = pers_t2) %>% 
  gather(Facet,value) %>% 
  rowwise() %>% 
  mutate(Score = numbers(value)[1]) %>% 
  ungroup() %>% 
  mutate(Time = c("Pre-Class","Pre-Class","Post-Class","Post-Class"),
         Time = ordered(Time,levels = c("Pre-Class","Post-Class"))) %>% 
  mutate(Facet = rep(c("Passion","Perseverance"),2)) 
if(pp$Score %>% is.na() %>% sum != 4){
  pp %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Time,y = Score,fill = Facet,col = Facet))+
  geom_col(position = "dodge",alpha= .5,col=NA)+
  geom_point(size=5)+
  geom_line(aes(group = Facet))+
  facet_wrap(~Facet,scales = "free")+
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(1,6)) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = 1:6)+
  theme_ang()+
  theme(text = element_text(size = 25))
}
```

___
Don't worry if the rubric doesn't yet reflect growth. It is only a coarse measure that cannot replace your own self-reflection. 

<p class="fragment">In any case, grit is not built in a day...</p>

<p class="fragment">...so stay passionate and persevering on the lifelong quest of choosing easy, working hard, and paying it forward.</p>

___

With grit and gratitude,

```{r, echo = F}
include_graphics("Sig.png")
```

Angela and the Grit Lab team.
